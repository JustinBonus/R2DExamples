summary: |
  This example demonstrates the damage assessment of electrical power network due to ground shaking and failure caused by earthquake using the HAZUS methodology. To achieve this, we use LA power network data that are already provided from BRAILS. The event data is generated using the Regional Earthquake Event Generation tool. The damage assessment is performed using the PELICUN damage model - inline with HAZUS methodology.
