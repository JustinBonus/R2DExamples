      "name": "E1 - Basic HAZUS",
      "description": "This earthquake example demonstrates rapid analysis capabilities with the HAZUS earthquake damage and loss assessment methodology. Building-level Damage and Losses (D&L) are calculated directly from Intensity Measures (IM) for 25 assets. The IM field that represents peak ground acceleration in the city of San Francisco, CA, from an Mw7.2 event on the San Andreas fault, was obtained from Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis (PSHA).\n",

      "description": "This example uses ground motions from the 2018 earthquake in Anchorage, AK, to characterize the response of buildings with an idealized MDOF building model through story-level Engineering Demand Parameters (EDP). Exploiting the refinement in EDPs, a HAZUS-based story-level assessment is employed to evaluate the performance of 10 buildings.\n",

      "description": "This example features ground motion acceleration time histories simulated using the SW4 software and a detailed geophysical model of the San Francisco Bay Area by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The ground motions are used to investigate the impact of a Mw7.0 earthquake on the Hayward fault on the city of Berkeley. Engineering Demand Parameters are simulated with an idealized MDOF building model; building performance is evaluated at the story-level based on the HAZUS earthquake damage and loss assessment methodology.\n",

Approximately 6,600 buildings with various occupancy types and construction materials are considered in Atlantic City, NJ, with specified rulesets for determining key building characteristics.\nA Category 5 intensity hurricane with 3-s gust peak wind speeds, obtained from the Storm Hazard Projection Tool (NJCoast project), is employed with HAZUS-Hurricane wind fragility functions to estimate building damage states and loss ratios.Â The peak wind speeds are calculated using a linear analytical model for the boundary layer winds (Snaiki and Wu, 2017), and the peak inundation heights are calculated from a surrogate model (Jia and Taflanidis, 2013).\n",
